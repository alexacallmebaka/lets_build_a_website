# Let's Build a Website ðŸ’ƒ

I gave this talk as the third installment of our Beginner's 
Series for HackKU24. In it, I teach HTML, CSS, and Flask to 
an audience of beginner programmers. Building 
on a Figma prototype from the previous HackKU Beginner's workshop, 
I walk hackers through creating a simple sign-in 
page that displays who has signed-in so far after a user fills in a form.

In this repo:
* Simple HTML example.
* Introductory Flask example.
* Basic decorator example.
* Workshop check-in page!
