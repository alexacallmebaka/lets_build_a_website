    <h1>Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹</h1>

    <p>

      Wow, this is pretty cool! In HTML, my text can be <strong>bold</strong>,
      we can use <em>italics</em>. We can also see that HTML doesn't support line
      breaks. 



      See it's still inline. <br/>
      Now we have a new line! ðŸ¤©


    </p>

    <p>
      New paragraphs also get their own lines.
